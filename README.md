# Multiplayer No Turn Chess

-This isn't your normal chess game as first of all, it is made with assembly and second unlike normal chess, it doesn't have turns i.e any player can move any piece whenever.

-This version of the game is only available in multiplayer, i.e the two players should have the same code and should be connected to the network in order to player




## Features

- Play Mode
- Chat Mode where players can chat to each other
- Cooldown where when a player moves one piece, they have to wait 3 seconds to move another
- Batch Mode (Enter when hitting 0) allows a player to make a batch of moves at the same time (This is done by choosing a row and a column of the starting cell and a row and column of the end cell)
- If The cell is found empty, a random piece of the player's is removed
- A random powerup will appear on a random on the board which when a player steps on it, their cooldown will be reduced to only 1 second

## Lessons Learned

- Writing modular code in assembly
- Making a GUI by drawing each individual pixel
- Making the mechanics of a complex game like chess
- Utilizing the Serial communication abillites of assembly
